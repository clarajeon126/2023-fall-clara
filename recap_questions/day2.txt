1. The command to compile a C program is gcc <source file> -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra. Use man or Google to find out the meaning of the four flags, i.e. -std=c99, -pedantic, -Wall and -Wextra.
-std=c99 : lets compiler know we are using the standard version c99 which was released in 1999
-pedantic : turns of extensions which leads to more warning messages
    ex) warns about string literals longer than 509 because it is not portable to use longer strings
-Wall : enables common warnings; gives warnings on things that some consider questionable and are easy to avoid
-Wextra : adds more warnings that arent included in Wall

2. Briefly describe what a preprocessor, compiler and linker do when transporting C code into executable?
proprocessor: scans, looks for directives, takes care (checks if they exist)
compiler: turn source code into object code
linker: take object code and combine it into one executable

3. What does an undefined behavior mean in programming? Do we need to care about it? Why or why not?
undefined behavior means a variable was not defined. we need to care about because the code can fail in mysterious ways. the failure can change depending on run.

4. What does the modifier const mean?
const makes a variable that can not be modified after it is assigned.

5. What are the primitive types in C and what are their byte sizes?
int : 4 bytes
unsigned : 4 bytes
long : 8 bytes
float : 4 bytes
double : 8 bytes
char : 1 byte
short: 2 bytes

6. What is the value of 7 / 2 (a division of two integers) in a C program?
7 / 2 = 3 bc its integer divison so it always rounds down.
